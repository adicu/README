<h2>Computer Science Core Classes</h2>

While most students end up taking these classes in the first two to three years, it’s totally fine to leave a class until senior year if it isn’t necessary for taking higher level classes. Note that we list “Useful Preparation” instead of “Prerequisites,” in order to convey what knowledge is strictly necessary for the course. Note that these may differ from the official prerequisites.

<h5>COMS W3134 - Data Structures in Java</h5>
<b>Common Name: </b>“31 34,” or “Data Structures”<br>
<b>Useful Preparation: </b>You should take 1004 or 1007 before taking this class, or otherwise be comfortable in Java.<br>
<b>Notes: </b> In this class, you learn the basic algorithms and data structures that will help you in internship interviews and industry. 

<h5>COMS W3137 - Honors Data Structures and Algorithms</h5>
<b>Common Name: </b>“31 37,” or “Honors Data Structures”<br>
<b>Useful Preparation: </b>You should take 1004 or 1007 before taking this class, or otherwise be comfortable in Java.<br>
<b>Notes: </b>Notes: In this class, you learn the basic algorithms and data structures that will help you in internship interviews and industry. Depending on the professor, Honors Data Structures may move slightly faster, cover more advanced data structures and algorithms, and have more extensive homework assignments.

<h5>COMS W3157 - Advanced Programming</h5>
<b>Common Name: </b>“AP”<br>
<b>Useful Preparation: </b>You should have taken 1004 or 1007 before you take this class, and be comfortable programming. Data structures is listed as a prerequisite, but isn’t strictly necessary.
<b>Notes: </b>This class is notoriously difficult, but an important class to take. After you take AP, you’ll be comfortable programming, using a UNIX shell, and be prepared to face more advanced classes in the CS department. <br>
<b>Other Notes: </b>AP requires you purchase a CS account, which costs $50, from the very beginning of the course. If this isn’t feasible for you, please talk to Jae (the instructor) or one of the teaching assistants of the course. Do not let this be a reason to not take the course or major in computer science!

<h5>COMS W3203 - Discrete Mathematics: Introduction to Combinatorics and Graph Theory</h5>
<b>Common Name: </b>“Discrete Math,” or “Discrete”<br>
<b>Useful Preparation: </b>None. <br>
<b>Notes: </b>This class is a useful introduction to theoretical computer science, which introduces mathematical techniques and proofs, used in classes like Algorithms and Computer Science Theory.<br>

<h5>SIEO W4150 - Introduction to Probability and Statistics</h5>
<b>Common Name: </b>“Prob Stat”<br>
<b>Useful Preparation: </b>None<br>
<b>Alternatives: </b>You can cover these topics more in depth, over two semesters, by taking STAT W4105 (Introduction to Probability) and STAT W4107 (Statistical Inference).<br>
<b>Notes: </b>This is an introduction to the basic probability and statistics that are used in upper level classes like Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and AI.

<h5>CSEE W3827 - Fundamentals of Computer Systems</h5>
<b>Common Name: </b>“Fundamentals”<br>
<b>Useful Preparation:</b> None<br>
<b>Notes: </b>This class is an introduction to the “low level” topics in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering. If you’re considering majoring in either of these fields, definitely take Fundamentals early on.
