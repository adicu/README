<h2>Academics</h2>

<h5>Is CS hard?</h5>
CS requires a good amount of logical thinking. If you consider yourself a “math/science” person, it should be right up your alley. But if you don’t, it still might be the right fit for you. Try out an introductory course like 1004!

<h5>I’m struggling in school. Is that okay? What do I do?</h5>
Yes, that’s perfectly normal. If you’re very concerned about your academic performance, you should talk to upperclassmen (maybe through ADI’s Cookies and Code) and TAs about it. Furthermore, there are help rooms dedicated to different subjects, such as the Math Help Room and Barnard Computer Science Help Room. Additionally, you can request tutoring from CSA.

<h5>Should I skip out of 1004/1007 and go directly to 3134?</h5>
If you come into college with a 5 on AP Computer Science and were programming in high school, you have the option to skip out of 1004. It is recommended that you take 1007 to bridge your high school and college computer science course load as 1007 teaches good programming practices and idioms, which many students never learn formally. Many 1007 students say that the material helped them in their jobs and internships.
