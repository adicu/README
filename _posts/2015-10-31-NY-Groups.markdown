<h3>New York Tech Meetup</h3>
[http://www.meetup.com/ny-tech/]

New York Tech Meetup organizes a consistently sold out monthly live demo event and afterparty featuring startups based out of New York. These events are a great way to see a sampling of what technologists are creating in the city and is a great venue to meet folks from the tech community beyond Columbia. If youâ€™re interested in attending, try to get tickets early! Fun fact: NY Tech Meetup is the largest meetup group in the world with 46,380 members as of September 2015.

<h3>hackNY</h3>
[http://hackny.org/a/]

hackNY is an organization defined by their two cornerstone initiatives: a semesterly hackathon and a summer fellowship. The hackathon is held twice a year, at NYU in the Fall and at Columbia at the Spring. You should go to both! The summer fellowship connects university students with NYC startups. When you accept the fellowship, you get matched with an NYC startup, and get extra resources and support. If you get an internship in NYC, you can also apply after the fact to make that startup part of the hackNY fellowship.
