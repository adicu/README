<h5>EECS E4340 - Computer Hardware Design</h5>
<b>Common Name:</b> "Hardware Design" <br>
<b>Useful Preparation:</b> Fundamentals <br>
<b>Notes: </b> Usually offered only in the fall.  Second half of semester
consists almost solely of project work designing some system in Verilog
(taught during the course).

<h5>CSEE W4823 - Advanced Logic Design</h5>
<b>Common Name: </b> "ALD" <br>
<b>Useful Preparation:</b> Fundamentals <br>
<b>Notes: </b> Focus on RTL (Register Transfer Level) system design.
Includes projects in VHDL (taught during the course).

<h5>CSEE W4824 - Computer Architecture</h5>
<b>Common Name: </b>"Architecture" <br>
<b>Useful Preparation:</b> Fundamentals <br>
<b>Notes: </b> Focus on design and architecture of computers.  Most useful
indicator of interest is the architecture portion of Fundamentals (MIPS ISA,
MIPS single-cycle processor, pipelined MIPS processor).  Usually offered
only in the spring.

<h5>CSEE W4840 - Embedded Systems</h5>
<b>Common Name: </b>"Embedded"<br>
<b>Useful Preparation:</b> AP, Fundamentals.  Familiarity with RTL design is
helfpul but not necessary. <br>
<b>Notes: </b> Focus on interaction between software and hardware.  Second
half of semester solely consists of project work that combines hardware and
software components.  Usually offered only in the spring.

<h5>CSEE E6868 - System-on-Chip Platforms</h5>
<b>Common Names: </b>"SoC"<br>
<b>Useful Preparation: </b> AP, Fundamentals.  Familiarity with RTL design
is helfpul but not necessary.  <br>
<b>Notes: </b> Focus on system-level design of SoCs and Embedded Systems.
Focuses on design at a slightly "higher-level" than Embedded Systems.  It's
listed as a 6xxx level course, but the only necessary pre-requiesites are
Fundamentals and AP.  The professor likes having undergraduates in the
class.  Usually offered only in the fall.
