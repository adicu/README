<h5>MATH V1207 - Honors Mathematics A & MATH V1208 Honors Mathematics B</h5>
<b>Common Name: </b>“Honors Math”<br>
<b>Useful Preparation: </b>Very high grade in Calc II or a 5 on AP Calculus BC<br>
<b>Alternatives: </b>Taking the traditional track: Calc III, Calc IV, and then Linear Algebra <br>
<b>Notes:</b> Honors Math combines Calc III, Calc IV, and Linear Algebra into a two-semester course. While difficult, it’s a great class to take for students interested in math, and who have done well in math classes in the past. It serves as a great introduction and foundation in proof-based math.

<h5>STAT W4400 - Statistical Machine Learning</h5>
<b>Common Name:</b> "Stat ML"<br>
<b>Useful Preparation: </b> Calculus I, Linear Algebra, Probability & Statistics<br>
<b>Notes:</b> This is a commonly taken course for CS majors. Depending on your track and advisor, it can replace Machine Learning as a requirement.
