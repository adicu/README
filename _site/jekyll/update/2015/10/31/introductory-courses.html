<h2> Introductory Course</h2>

<p>If you’re interested in Computer Science, you should take one of these four courses as soon as possible to see if you want to continue with the major. If possible, take them first semester.</p>

<h5>COMS W1002 - Computing in Context <br></h5>

<p><b>Common Name: </b>“Ten Oh Two,” or “Computing in Context”<br>
<b>Notes:</b> If you’re not an engineer and you don’t think you want to major in Computer Science, 1002 might be a good option. Engineers or possible CS majors should instead start with 1004 or 1006. This class is intended for non-majors.</p>

<h5>COMS W1004 - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Java <br></h5>

<p><b>Common Name: </b>“Ten Oh Four,” or “Java”<br>
<b>Notes:</b> This class should be your default choice if you want to be a Computer Science major. It gives a strong foundation in Computer Science and serves as a prerequisite for Data Structures.</p>

<h5>ENGI E1006 - Introduction to Computing for Engineers and Applied Scientists<br></h5>

<p><b>Common Name: </b>“Ten Oh Six,” or “Python”<br>
<b>Notes:</b> Python is a really useful language to know, especially if you’re considering a different field in engineering other than Computer Science. If you’re certain that you want to be a Computer Science major, 1004 and 1007 give a stronger introduction to the field of Computer Science, where 1006 is more of an introduction to programming. This is a requirement for a SEAS Computer Science majors, but not GS, BC, or CC.</p>

<h5>COMS W1007 - Honors Introduction to Computer Science<br> </h5>

<p><b>Common Name: </b>“Ten Oh Seven,” or “Honors Java”<br>
<b>Notes:</b> 1007 is a fantastic class to take, but only if you have past experience in Java. While some students choose to skip both 1004 and 1007 (and go straight to Data Structures) if they have Java experience (e.g. got a 5 in AP Computer Science), such students should consider taking 1007 anyway. This class teaches good programming practices and idioms, which many students never learn formally. Many 1007 students say that the material helped them in their jobs and internships.</p>
