          <h2>Internships/Jobs</h2>

<h4>What’s an internship?</h4>

<p>An internship is a fixed-term job at a company for potential employees. In tech unlike in many other industries, most internships are paid positions. Many students choose to pursue internships as early as their freshman summer, and some students do internships during the school year as well. Research is popular alternative to an internship in industry, and some students find such opportunities more accessible their first-year summer.</p>

<p>It is common not to do an internship during your first-year summer, but doing so is often very rewarding and may help with other opportunities down the line. </p>

<h4>What classes should I take to prepare for a software engineering internship?</h4>

<p>Most internships do not expect you to know much outside of data structures and algorithms and being able to think through a problem. However, starting an internship with prior knowledge may give you the opportunity to take on more advanced projects which could yield a better experience.</p>

<p>Depending on the type of company that you’re interning at, different classes may give you more relevant information. You should take the classes that you are interested in and try to get an internship in that area of study.</p>

<p>That being said, companies do expect you to be proficient with data structures and algorithms during the interview process, so you should take Data Structures and Algorithms (COMS W3134/W3137) in preparation for interviews.</p>

<h4>How do I find out about internships other than through LionShare?</h4>

<p><li><b>Talk to upperclassmen and professors: </b>Talk to your TAs and professors, as well as upperclassmen that you can find through student groups on campus. For example, go to Cookies and Code (by ADI) and just ask someone!</p>

<p><li><b>Recruiting events on campus: </b>Many companies will hold recruiting events on campus throughout the year (especially larger ones). Keep on the lookout for these events coming to campus. Announcements will usually go out on the CS department mailing list, or through the communications of a student group.</p>

<p><li><b>ADI’s Startup Career Fair:</b> Every fall, ADI brings a bunch of startups to campus for a career fair. It’s casual (don’t wear a suit!) and is a great way to meet smaller companies that don’t have the ability to run events on campus or attend a Columbia career fair</p>

<p><li><b>Columbia career fairs: </b>Columbia holds career fairs for both CC and SEAS. Look online to find the dates for them. It’s relatively difficult to get noticed as a freshman, but it’s not impossible! Expect to wear business formal attire.</p>

<p><li><b>Company Websites: </b>If you want to work for a company, go to the jobs or careers page on their website to find out the best way to contact them! Usually, another method is preferred, but if all else fails definitely do this.</p>

<p><li><b>CS Undergrad Listserv: </b>The CS department has an undergraduate listserv with very frequent job postings from companies who’ve reached out to the CS department directly (in addition to the occasional report of free pizza). </p>

<h4>How does the process for applying to an internship work?</h4>

<ol>
<li><b>Introduction: </b>Either you apply for the job, are introduced to a recruiter, or do a programming challenge that they post on their website.
<li><b>Phone/Skype Interview: </b>You hop on a phone call with an engineer, where they’ll ask you questions - some about your experience, and others to test your technical abilities. Often, you will be asked to write code in some shared online editor (like CollabEdit).
<li><b>More Phone/Skype Interviews: </b>Depending on the company, the number of phone interviews will vary.
<li><b>In-Person Interviews (sometimes): </b>If the company does in-person interviews, you will be invited to come to their office to meet engineers and other team members. There will be in person coding interviews, as well an opportunity for you to socialize with the team members and learn more about what it’s like to work at the company.
</ol>

<h4>How should I prepare for an interview?</h4>

<p><li>Take Data Structures early - it&#39;s extremely useful for most interviews.</li>
<li>Mock interviews are extremely important! It takes time to get used to vocalizing your thoughts while you code, so practicing with friends before the actual interview will be helpful.</li>
<li>Prepare for the non-technical questions beforehand as well - be sure you can talk about your resume, what areas of CS you&#39;re most interested in, and why you want to work at the company you&#39;re interviewing for. Also, come up with a few questions to ask your interviewer to show your interest in the company!</li>
<li>Don&#39;t be discouraged if you bomb your first interview. It happens to everyone, and you can only improve from there!</li></p>

<h4>What kinds of questions are asked in interviews?</h4>

<p>Tech interviews can consist of both non-technical and technical questions. You should do some research on the sorts of questions that come up for a particular company. Some resources for preparation can be found below:

<h4>What are some internship programs freshmen can apply to?</h4>

<p><li><b>Google Engineering Practicum: </b>This is Google’s software engineering internship for freshmen and sophomores. 
<li><b>Facebook University: </b>Sometimes called Facebook U, this program is an internship exclusively for freshmen that includes a multi-week tutorial in mobile app development.
<li><b>Code2040:</b> A program for Black and Latino engineers that pairs students with jobs in the tech industry.
<li><b>Microsoft Explore/Foundry Internship: </b>Microsoft also has a program that helps freshmen and sophomores get exposed to software engineering. The Foundry program is based on working on building and shipping a product with other interns in a team that includes developers, designers, and product managers.
<li><b>Qualcomm Early Identification Program:</b> This program offers opportunities in Systems, Hardware, and Software Engineering. 
<li><b>Hack NY Fellows:</b> This program pairs students with startups to provide a strong mentoring environment.</p>

<h4>How do I get the attention of a recruiter?</h4>

<p><li>Go to on-campus events by companies (they’re always for recruiting)
<li>Talking to employees is great at career fairs, but always talk to the recruiters!
<li>Go to hackathons, and speak to recruiters there, try learning new skills from people around you.
<li>Be creative - use your connections, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc to get in touch!</p>
